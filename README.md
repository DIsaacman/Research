# Bridgewater Associates

### ***Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study***

## Background

Bridgewater is a large financial services institute that has grown from a Hedge Fund, to a world class people organisation. The founder, Ray Dalio was an early pioneer of Big Data, Machine Learning and Fintech.[^1] Bridgewater developed a principle-based approach designed by its founder, Ray Dalio to manage both money and people. Bridgewater has a large portfolio of assets under managment, holding mostly traditional equities.[^4] Although the original founder has taken a step back of the day-to-day managment of the company, many of his principles (that have been made public in his book "Principles") have been embedded into the company culture, helping Bridgeater become one of the most relevant corporations in existence. Of particular interest is how the company also uses data to encourage and enforce governance using an "idea Meritocracy" and "Believability-weighted decision-making" in the management of the organisation.

## Overview and Origin

  Business Name: Bridgewater Associates 

  Incorporated: 1975

  Founder: Raymond Dalio 
 

The name Bridgewater arose because he (Ray) initially attempted to sell commodities from the U.S to other countries, therefore, they were ‘bridging the waters’. However, the company moved on to focus more on being a consultancy(/asset management) firm.[^2]
 
The company recieved it's first large funding round in 1987 in the form of a Fixed Income Loan from Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of the World Bank (US $5M). 

Since 1991 Bridgewater has raised several venture funds, accumulating $US ~200B assets under management whereby they manage assets on behalf of soficsticated investors including pension funds and organisats balance sheets.

Bridgewater uses a standard hedge fund model, which takes a 2% management fee of assets and 20% of yearly profits accrued from using an investment system.

## Business Activities:


A Hedge fund's purpose is to maximise investor returns while minimising risk. 

Bridgewater has set itself apat over time for delivering some of the best returns in the industry. The company manages capital on behlaf of private institutional investors in an effort to hedge against market risk. Bridgewater is known for taking large positions in Securities including Equities, Bonds, Currencies, and Treasury Bills. The company also produces a stream of analysis and research for it's clients.

Initially the company recieved funding from high networth individuals that are classified as sophisticated investors. However, the clientell now consists only of Pension Funds and Sovereign Wealth Funds. 

These large organisations endowments allow Bridgewater to manage and custody their assets, usuually on behlf of a larger client base. One example of a large client of bridgewater is the National Australia Bank (NAB) based in Melbourne. Customers are approximately 50% US and 50% overseas.

### Unique Selling Points 


#### Creative Use of Data


The company has an edge by harnessing "principles" (logically justified decisions) into computer based programs to run simulations on vast amounts of data. by codifying succesful investment decisions and outcomes, the algoriths can assist the decision making process when buying and selling securities to make profit. The company has a significant amount of research analysts that set up theri professional relationships for succesful partnerships trhough education and information dissemination.

#### Organisational Transparency


On an organisational level, all of the data is shared freely within the comapany. Even the conferences are recorded and readily avaialble to promote a culture where information can flow. This unique and radical transparency allows for a people centric business model where the best decisions can rise from the bottom to the top.


#### Risk Based Assets (Contrarian Investing)


Among Bridgewaters' contraversial investments against Europe recently is its long standing position  within the Chinese financial markets. This may be considered particularly risky based on the informal agreements that the US and China have when it comes to the true ownership of Securities outside of China. The company's edge has been a sharp focus on securing compliant relationships with Chinese Government and Corporate Officials over a long time horizon.

These relationships are what dictated his decision-making rules and principles, which he recorded each time...He used to write on the back of envelopes and other bits of paper until he got his first PC and was able to start programming what he needed.
