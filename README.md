## Background



Bridgewater is a prominent financial services institution that has grown as a leading Hedge Fund and a world-class people organisation. 

Bridgewater has an extensive portfolio of assets under management.[^4] 

The founder, Ray Dalio, was an early pioneer of Big Data, Machine Learning and Fintech.[^1] 

Bridgewater pioneered a principle-based approach to designed systems to manage money and people. 

Although the founder has taken a step back from the company's day-to-day management, many of his principles (which have been made public in his book "Principles") have been embedded into the company culture quantitively and qualatively.

Of particular interest is how the company culture uses data to encourage and guide governance decisions based on structured frameworks, including "Idea Meritocracy" and "Believability-Weighted Decision-Making" in the organisation's day-to-day management. As a result, Bridgewater often operates of the boundaries of technological innovation and investment strategies, using vast amounts of data and code in productive ways.

## Overview and Origin



  Business Name: Bridgewater Associates 

  Incorporated: 1975

  Founder: Raymond Dalio 
 

The name Bridgewater arose because he (Ray) initially attempted to sell commodities from the U.S to other countries. Therefore, they were ‘bridging the waters’. However, the company focuses on wealth advisory, consultancy and asset management.[^2]
 
The company received its first significant funding round in 1987 as a Fixed Income Loan from Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of the World Bank (US $5M). Their first large client was McDonalds, where Ray allegedly helped secure the product pricing for the classic chicken Nugget based on his extensive knowledge of commodities and futures markets.

Since 1991 Bridgewater has raised several venture funds, accumulating $USD **~200B** assets under management whereby they manage assets on behalf of institutional (as opposed to retail or sophisticated) investors, including pension funds, foundations, endowments and central banks.

One example of a large client of Bridgewater is the National Australia Bank (NAB), based in Melbourne. 

Customers are approximately 50% US and 50% overseas.

The **minimum** investment is usually around USD $10M.

Bridgewater uses a standard hedge fund model, which takes a 2% management fee of assets and 20% of yearly profits accrued from using an investment system.



### Publicly Known Funding:



| Year          | Description                   | Amount (USD $)|

| 2003          |Alpha Major Markets Hedge Fund | ~10 B         |

Bridgwater also publishes a white paper called the "Daily Observations", which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis.



## Business Activities:



A Hedge fund's purpose is to maximise investor returns while minimising risk. The average investor in a given sector cannot beat a low-cost index after expenses. 

Hedge funds usually employ active and passive capital management to beat the market returns while indirectly exposing clients to a diverse and potentially uncorrelated basket of assets.

Bridgewater has set itself apart over time for delivering some of the best returns in the industry. 

The company manages capital on behalf of private institutional investors to hedge against market risk. Bridgewater is known for taking significant positions in Securities, including Equities, Bonds, Currencies, and Treasury Bills. The company also produces a stream of analysis and research for its clients.

### Unique Selling Points 



#### Creative Use of Data



 The company has an edge by harnessing "principles" (logically justified decisions) into computer-based programs to run simulations on vast amounts of data. By codifying successful investment decisions and outcomes, the algorithms can assist the decision-making process when buying and selling securities for profit. 



#### Organisational Transparency



 On an organisational level, almost all data is shared freely within the company. Even the conferences are recorded and readily available to promote a culture where information can flow. This unique and radical transparency allows for a people-centric business model where the best decisions can rise from the bottom to the top.



#### Risk Based Assets (Contrarian Investing)



 Strategically, the focus of a large hedge fund is on currency and fixed income markets in contrast to buying individual shares in a company. 
 
 Bridgewater uses quantitive risk management and diversification models by buying and/or short selling to maintain a risk target level. The exact investment portfolios are primarily secretive as the industry is competitive and the investment intellectual property is not publicly available.

 Bridgewaters' is also known for taking controversial investments against Europe and favouring a long-standing position within the Chinese financial markets. 
 
 Within the USA, investments in Chinese markets may be considered particularly risky based on the informal agreements the US and China have regarding the true ownership of Securities outside of China. 
 
 The company's edge has been an active approach with a sharp focus on securing respectful relationships with the Chinese Government and Corporate Officials over a long time horizon.[^6]



### Tech Stack



On the company's website, under "Job Descriptions", there are several skills and tech stacks that Bridgewater is using. 

Besides the Proprietary Languages [^5] and multiple patents for technologies; the company is known to use:

- Proprietary | Automated Management Systems for Decision Making

## Results



In 2005 Bridgewater became the largest hedge fund in terms of assets under management. They have consistently led by setting the industry benchmark for financial returns on investment and their operation as a large organisation.[^7]

In 2007, the financial decisions placed the company in a fortunate position to profit from the impending 2008 financial crisis. 

Ray Dalio studied the history of market collapses by analysing the economic changes over 500 years. In addition, Ray published a paper in 2008 titled "How the Economic Machine Works: A Template for Understanding What is Happening Now", an essay assessing the potential of various economies by various criteria.

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0) of the same name exists and is crucial in the understanding of market cycles as they relate to debit and credit.

Bridgewater has cemented itself as a premium global macro firm by successfully investing around economic trends, such as changes in exchange rates, inflation, and G.D.P. growth. By taking an expansive view of the economy. 

Billions of dollars affect moving markets, and large hedge funds have a unique responsibility to allocate and deploy their funds responsibly in a diverse manner by investing in uncorrelated assets.

The company is a pioneer of automated decision-making to save time and mitigate human emotions when dealing with fear, greed and biases.



## Recommendations



The world is changing.

Information is becoming more decentralised, and the prospect of cutting the intermediaries and bankers is becoming a reality.

Considering how much time, research and money have likely gone into developing the governance structures and technology within Bridgewater, it would be interesting to see if the emergence of the DAO structure may influence an organisation such as Bridgewater.

It is still early for the concept of a Decentralised Autonomous Organise (DAO), but I strongly believe that Bridgewater would be an ideal candidate for becoming a pioneer in the governance space.

If offered as part of their consultancy package, the company could gain additional revenue to cover operating expenses while promoting the emergence of an entirely new industry around complex decision-making frameworks.

The "Idea Meritocracy" and "Believability-Weighted Decision-Making" frameworks could be codified as a boilerplate to adapt depending on company structure and culture.

The additional layer of transparency within private organisations solidifies the process of governance-based decision-making.

The DAO could run on Hyperledger, IBM or other enterprise-grade software suites for private companies and could also easily be modelled on public ledgers such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
